Looking at the picture *remainders* in this folder, we can see this kind of cyclical repeating pattern happening as we add up numbers. It resets every 4 numbers, that can e very useful. 

Imagine we have a counter that's counting up from the start of our game, like for example how long the level has been active or something similar. We can then use that information to make some decisions. Say for example, this was something happening every 4 seconds in our game, and our game has been running for 9 seconds at that point. We can say that would be one second into cycle 3.  (look at the diagram in the pic).

That would be useful if you we are looking for the cycle counter that repeats evry 30 seconds, and know what cycle it currently is; if the game lasts for 30 levels, this would be level 3.
